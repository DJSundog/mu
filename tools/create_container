# Start a Linux container containing the mu/ directory.
# Useful on non-Linux platforms.
# Run it from the top-level mu/ directory.

docker run -it --name mu -v `pwd`:/mu abyssos/abyss:dev

# On the first startup, you'll need to run the following commands:
#   apk add git nano libcxx-dev
#   cd /mu

# Leaving this container will stop it.
# Restart it with:
#   docker start mu
#
# Now you can connect to it anytime with:
#   docker exec -it mu sh
#   cd /mu
#
# Quite slow, though. Docker has to run a VM on other platforms.
