0. main's ingredients
1. assertion failures or errors inside scenarios
2. screen background color
3. more touch event types

termbox issues are implementation-specific and not worth testing:
  latency in interpreting low-level escape characters

  event-loop needs to call update-cursor explicitly to backstop branches doing their own minimal rendering
  solution: update-cursor after minimal rendering
