# Drawing tiles on screen

This directory contains a series of prototypes. For more details on the
organization of this directory and building, see [the parent directory](..).

Once you've followed the instructions for building a prototype, run most of
them like this:

```
$ ./a.elf
```

See the code of individual prototypes for further instructions.
