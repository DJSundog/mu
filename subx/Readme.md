## The SubX VM

Bytecode interpreter for a subset of the 32-bit x86 ISA.

* Only instructions that operate on the 32-bit E*X registers.
* Only instructions that assume a flat address space; no instructions that use
  segment registers.
* No instructions that check the carry or parity flags; arithmetic operations
  always operate on signed numbers (while bitwise operations always operate on
  unsigned numbers)
* Only relative jump instructions (with 8-bit or 16-bit offsets).

Basically a minimum basis set that a compiler for Mu can target. This isn't
meant to run arbitrary binaries, just those generated by our compiler,
allowing better tests for the compiler, access to processor/memory state
without getting bogged down in details of the ELF format, ABI, STABS debugging
format, etc., etc.

To run tests:

  ```
  ./subx test
  ```
