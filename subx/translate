# Translate SubX using the self-hosted translator.
#
# Possible knobs:
#   Whether to run a phase directly or emulated.
#     Just always emulate for now since we debug on non-Linux.
#   Whether to stop after a phase.
#     Just always run all phases, but print out phases so it's clear where an error happens.
#   Whether to trace a phase. Whether to always trace or rerun with tracing enabled after an error.
#     Leave tracing to other scripts. We save intermediate files so it's easy to rerun a single phase afterwards.
#   Whether to run a phase with debug information. (Need to juggle multiple sets of debug files.)
#     Again, that's for subsequent scripts.
