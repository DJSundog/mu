# A little hack. We want translate_subx to always emit identical binaries to
# the C++ translator. The C++ translator assorts segments before it processes
# string literals, so we follow the same order above.
#
# However, dquotes currently emits a separate data segment for string literals.
# So we need to run assort a second time to clean up after it.
#
# Potential solutions:
#   a) modify C++ translator to process string literals before assorting.
#   b) clean up dquotes to assume assorted segments, and append to the
#   existing data segment.
